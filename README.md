# Python Pathfinder with Dijkstra's Algorithm

This Python project implements a pathfinding algorithm using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a maze-like environment. The maze is represented as a 2D matrix, and the code comments within the repository provide detailed explanations of the implementation.

## Features

- **Maze as a Matrix**: The maze is represented as a 2D matrix, where 1s denote open paths, and 0s denote walls.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in the maze.

- **Real-time Visualization**: Visualize the maze, pathfinding process, and final path in real-time using the Pygame library.

- **Interactive Maze Creation**: Create custom mazes by setting walls, start points, and destination points using a graphical interface.

- **Configurable Block Size**: Adjust the size of each grid block in the maze to create larger or smaller environments.

# Example
- **Blocksize 25 and 100
